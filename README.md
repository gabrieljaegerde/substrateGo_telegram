With this bot users can easily **create** and **collect** treasures.

## Game Play

>*KusamaGo is like **geo-caching with NFT rewards***.

Users can take on roles of **Creator** and **Finder** interchangibly.

In **creator** mode users can **create** and **edit treasures** as well as track their progress. By editing a treasure, the creator can **customize** the **NFT** that users will receive when collecting their treasure.

In the **finder** mode users have tools to find treasures near them. It's easy to **collect treasures** and view collected ones. Collected treasures exist as **NFTs** on the **Kusama** blockchain.

Albeit low (a few USD cents), transactions on the Kusama chain incur a network cost. This **cost** is incurred when an **NFT** gets **minted** (at treasure collection) and to be paid by the collector. A user is therefore required to **connect** their account to their **wallet** before being able to collect treasures. The NFTs (for the treasures collected) will also be sent to that wallet. Any account related tasks can easily be take care of in the **Account Settings**
